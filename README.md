# FPGA Blink LED

LED blinking design in Verilog HDL developed and simulated using **Xilinx Vivado**, demonstrating clock division and synchronous digital design concepts.

This project is implemented on a **Virtex-7 FPGA**.


## 🧠 Design Overview
- Written in Verilog HDL
- Uses clock division to generate visible LED blinking
- Synchronous design with reset support
- Target FPGA: Virtex-7


## 🔬 Simulation Results
The following waveform shows the functional simulation of the LED blinking behavior.
